Notes on XOrduino v4 boards:
 - avoid tab on usb connector, move to body
 - N/C jumpers turned out N/O (scratch sensor board)
.- merge 5V and +5V nets
 - C5/C7 too close together (and too close to C9) & need polarity marks
 - C11/C13 needs polarity mark (or to be unpolarized)
 - flip RN3?
 - audio jack footprints are wrong.  and drill holes overlap for top&bottom
 - just use tip and sleeve(gnd) on audio jack (leave ring(s) disconnected)
   use 1/8" instead of 3/32"?
   digikey CP1-3523N-ND $0.39480 qty 100 (stereo, no switch)
 - right angle pot is right but don't need strain relief holes, need knob (shorter handle?)
.- mini USB jack silkscreen on wrong side
.- mini USB just a tiny bit too close to pcb plug
 - mounting hole clearances too small:
    
 - add front nose skid (near where audio jack currently sits?)
 - potentiometer footprint 
 - add light sensors and/or bumper switches somehow
   light sensors pointed at the wheels?
 - add labels to new arduino 1.0 pins (SCL/SDA above AREF)
 - add breakoff tabs to thicken USB plug (by reset pin, two deep)
 - solder spot under AVR is unnecessary
 - male header strip should be female for arduino headers
   1x S7004-ND (6 pin)
   2x S4008-ND (non-stock) or S7006-ND (8 pin)
   1x S7043-ND (10 pin) or S7008-ND (should be cheaper, but isn't)
 - ISP header needs pin 1 indication, label.
 - Yellow LEDs don't have a flat side!
 - add LED polarity silkscreen
 - remove solder mask on solder jumper center
 - replace 2x7 shorting header w/ 1x7 signal header and array of
   shorting jumpers

NOTE THAT ATmega32u4 should be placed upside down. (rotate it?)

TESTED: xorduino can be programmed w/ nothing mounted but the chip and
the ISP header.
