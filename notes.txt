Notes on v4:
 - avoid tab on usb connector, move to body
 - N/C jumpers turned out N/O (scratch sensor board)
 - merge 5V and +5V nets
 - C5/C7 too close together (and too close to C9) & need polarity marks
 - C11/C13 needs polarity mark (or to be unpolarized)
 - flip RN3?
 - audio jack footprints are wrong.  and drill holes overlap for top&bottom
 - just use tip and sleeve(gnd) on audio jack (leave ring(s) disconnected)
   use 1/8" instead of 3/32"?
 - right angle pot is right but don't need strain relief holes, need knob (shorter handle?)
 - mini USB jack silkscreen on wrong side & just a tiny bit too close
   to pcb plug
 - mounting hole clearances too small:
    
 - add front nose skid (near where audio jack currently sits?)
 - potentiometer footprint 
 - add light sensors and/or bumper switches somehow
   light sensors pointed at the wheels?
 - add labels to new arduino 1.0 pins (SCL/SDA above AREF)
 - add breakoff tabs to thicken USB plug (by reset pin, two deep)
 - solder spot under AVR is unnecessary
 - male header strip should be female for arduino headers
 - ISP header needs pin 1 indication, label.
 - Yellow LEDs don't have a flat side!

NOTE THAT ATmega32u4 should be placed upside down.

TESTED: xorduino can be programmed w/ nothing mounted but the chip and
the ISP header.
