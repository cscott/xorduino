Hall Sensor Board:
 AH180N-ZG-7DICT-ND is default part, thresh 35g (max 50g)
investigate:
 TCS10DLU(TE85L,F) ($.07 more), thresh 18g (max 25g) <- twice as good
   are footprints compatible?

v6:
- RN7 too close to skid screw hole
- U4 (motor driver) doesn't have pin1 mark
- missing 2 red LEDs LED2/LED3
- LED dot indicator is on wrong side; use the notation from bottom of LED
- unmask vias below motor driver and switcher
- L3 footprint could be larger
removed U1 from xorduino #2 (then replaced)
U3 wrong on BOM; coil wrong, too.
user switch makes it hard to insert wires in left hand screw terminal
taps on AISEN/BISEN to measure motor currents?
seeing 1.5v drop on optical sensor; max freq 83Hz (min period 12ms)
  probably design for 1ms min pulse time.
  small stripe / large stripe for direction? XX
  if we want direction we need another pair of sensors, w/ different phase

  a b c d == where a!=c, b!=d.  maybe just
    short long longer (a b c)
  forward = > > < > > <
  backward= < < > < < >
   in a/c states, need to be able to distinguish length of states for direction
  we could also assume that transitions are "rare"

  short LONG long SHORT -- using length to distinguish assumes
  constant speed (or places limits on speed of accel/decel, which may
  be reasonable) (lower is mark, upper is space)

weaker pullup for RN5?  can go to 150k at least.
 (digikey: 150k RN5, wire wrap, caps and inductors for power supply)
run board directly from 6V battery pack, maybe w/ diode?
jumper VUSB to VCCIO, jumper VCCIO to +5V.  Wire jumpers?

-----------------------
- Move USB PCB connector to bottom corner (near phone jacks), which lets
  you plug in to the vertical slot on the XO when it is closed (in
  "tablet mode")
- move light sensor to USB connector side of XOrduino so it is not
  shaded by backpack XO Stick.

- usb micro jack is just too small to reasonably hand solder
- move light sensor over to where usb micro jack is
- move usb tab connector to bottom corner
- nylon standoff at front, not conductive Al
- bottom standoff screw needs a touch of glue?
- rubber band around board to secure battery pack
- servo connector is close to pot connection and very similar.
  disambiguate for more reliable assembly?
- check wire gauge for screw terminal
- body of pot might short against USB mini connector.
  - move USB mini to place occupied by USB micro
    and move it back away from the edge of the board a hair
    so it's even w/ pcb board edge and doesn't interfere
    w/ pcb usb connector
.- u2 has stripe not dot
?- L3 footprint seems small
.- markings: 103 on RN2, 104 on RN4/5, 221 on RN6, 102 on RN3, 220 on
  RN1, 1.0 on RN7

.- XO Stick: label U2 with arduino pin names.
- remind people to email me their mailing address
- ask folks if they have an AVR programmer
